                        A job in computers offers competitive pay and substantial growth prospects. Employment in computer and 
                        information technology occupations is expected to expand by 15% between 2021 and 2031, which is much faster 
                        than the average for all occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics. The growing need 
                        for big data, cloud computing, and information security is what's behind this spike. Furthermore, as of May 
                        2023, the median yearly salary for these occupations was $104,420, which was much greater than the median for 
                        all occupations.
